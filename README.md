===============

GOV.UK elements is three things:

1. [An online design guide](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/), explaining how to make your service look consistent with the rest of GOV.UK.
2. An example of how to use the code in the [GOV.UK template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template) and the [GOV.UK frontend toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit).
3. An [npm package of the Sass files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/govuk-elements-sass).

# Using govuk-elements-sass

Installation and usage instructions can be found in the govuk-elements-sass [README](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/blob/master/packages/govuk-elements-sass/README.md).

## Running this site locally

If you would like to clone the repository and run it locally,
you will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (at least version v0.10.0).

Clone this repository

    git clone git@github.com:alphagov/govuk_elements.git

    npm start

Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


## Running tests

To check the whole codebase, run:

    npm test

## Linting

### GOV.UK lint
[GOV.UK elements uses govuk-lint](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-lint#sass), which uses [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) as its scss linter.

### Standard JavaScript
GOV.UK elements uses [standardjs](http://standardjs.com/), an opinionated JavaScript linter. All JavaScript files follow its conventions.

Both linters run on CI to ensure that new pull requests are in line with them.


## Add govuk_elements to your project

### Install with NPM
From the command line, run the following to include elements as a dependency in your project:
```bash
npm install --save alphagov/govuk_elements
```

### Require the code
Code can be required in the standard way (even on the client if using `browserify`):
```javascript
// polyfill `details` elements on older browsers
require('govuk-elements/assets/javascripts/govuk/details.polyfill');
```


## Running Wraith to compare changes

GOV.UK elements uses Wraith so that regressions can be easily spotted.

This needs to be run from the Wraith directory `/tests/wraith` and some dependencies need to be installed on the local machine first.

1. Install Wraith and its dependencies.

    gem install wraith
    brew install phantomjs
    brew install imagemagick

2. Take a baseline of the current version.

On master run:

    wraith history config.yaml


3. Switch to your feature branch and make changes.

On your feature branch run:

    wraith latest config.yaml
