# 3.0.1

- Update govuk_frontend_toolkit to 5.1.2 ([PR #425](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/425)). This updates show-hide-content.js to work with new .multiple-choice custom radio buttons and checkboxes, released in GOV.UK elements 3.0.0.
- Ensure that table cells using tabular-numbers are 19px ([PR #424](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/424)).

# 3.0.0

- Breaking changes to form validation ([#PR 405](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/405))

This adds two new classes: `.form-group-error` and `.form-control-error`, and removes the old `.error` class. This lets specific controls within a group be accurately marked as having errors. For example, this allows parts of a date entry to be marked rather than the whole section.

To upgrade, you’ll need to change any occurences of `.error` that were applied to form groups to be `.form-group-error`, and then add `.form-control-error` to the failing input inside.

- Radio buttons and checkboxes have new markup that doesn’t need JavaScript ([PR #406](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/406))

Previously the radio buttons and checkboxes relied on selection-buttons.js (from [govuk_frontend_toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit)) to work. By reworking the markup (see [examples](govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/form-elements/#form-radio-buttons)) we’ve been able remove this requirement.

To upgrade, you’ll need to change your markup to match the new pattern. Once that has been done you’ll be able to stop including selection-buttons.js and remove [the `GOVUK.SelectionButtons` constructor](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit/blob/master/docs/javascript.md#selection-buttons) from your JavaScript. The look and feel remains the same barring some tweaks to the focus weight. Accessibility and device compatibility remains the same as the previous version.

- Add examples of phase tags used outside of phase banners ([PR #366](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/366))
- Fix invisible input content when changing colours ([PR #397](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/397))
- Recommend the use of `aria-current="page"` for the last breadcrumb ([PR #418](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/418))

# 2.2.1

- Fix contrast issues with phase banners. Use $govuk-blue for the phase tag and update the examples ([PR #364](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/364)).

# 2.2.0

- New radio buttons and checkboxes ([PR #296](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/296))

You will need to make sure that your version of the GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit is at least 4.17.0.

# 2.1.2

- Add snippets for data visualisation examples ([PR #351](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/351)) and ([PR #350](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/350))
- Fix the grey left hand border example for Radios and checkboxes ([PR #349](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/349))
- Fix the spacing underneath the "inline" block label example ([PR #348](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/348))

# 2.1.1

- Fix focus outline on form fields in Chrome / Safari ([PR #346](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/346))
- Updates the contribution guidelines ([PR #339](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/339))
- Recommend `.visually-hidden` over `.visuallyhidden` ([PR #341](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/341))

# 2.1.0

- Update govuk_frontend_toolkit to 5.0.0 and govuk_template to 0.19.0 ([PR #333](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/333))
- Add a select box example ([PR #303](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/303))

- Remove external link styles ([PR #274](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/274))

# 2.0.0

- Remove the images path override from the helpers partial ([PR #292](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/292)). This will break background images that are currently using the `file-url` function from [the url-helpers partial in the frontend toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit/blob/d54c9b26d314a6e6cb50ba90f6e96ca50049498f/stylesheets/_url-helpers.scss). As `$path` will vary from project to project you will need to define this in your main application stylesheet.
- Bump govuk frontend toolkit to 4.16.1 ([PR #288](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements/pull/288)). This adds space key activation to links with a role of button.
