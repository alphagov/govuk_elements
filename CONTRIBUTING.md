# Guidelines

In the spirit of open source, we welcome contributions. These can be as trivial as fixing typos or grammatical errors, to suggesting new areas of guidance in the style guide.

We will review your submission and may suggest amendments via the comments system. However, we are not obliged to accept all contributions and will maintain editorial control.

## Process
Submissions should be made as pull requests. Each piece will be reviewed by a content specialist, who will make sure it stays true to the GOV.UK style as well as the spirit of the manual.

Once a change has been submitted it will stay open as a pull request for a few days so that teams throughout GDS and beyond get a chance to review and comment.
